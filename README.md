# C++ Algorithms Practice

I'll warn you, this repo is quite... boring. If you are so inclined, you can build and test with the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattlisle/algorithms-cpp.git
cd algorithms-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && make install && make test
```

There is a driver for each subsection of this project, so once it's built, any of the `bin/*-demo` executables can be run (in case you're that bored).

Running any of the `*-demo`s without any arguments will display a usage menu. Happy github stalking!
